<em>Replica of persona via machina</em>
=======
<p>Project started back to Oct 2020</p>
*Objective: Replicate persona in digital manner</p>
*Method: Machine assisted</p>
*Result: <em>unknown</em></p>
<hr />

<p>Rev Identity 1- YN</p>
<p>Rev Identity 2- QY</p>

<p>Steps to be executed:</p>
<p>Collect target related media (video, audio, 3D scan, etc.) as much as possible, time label must be recorded together since the persona varies with time propagation.</p>
<p>Fuse the media information to be a `raw soup`, where a classified model will be built upon it.</p>
<p>The classification of information helps to improve the chance of success of a rebuilt persona upon 'raw soup', while being said even without such classified model a persona reflecting Rev Identity can still be founded.</p>
